		        <h2>Deck</h2>
		        <img src="images/deck.jpg" alt="decks" class="center">
			         <p>Modern decks vary in size, but most are 7 to 10.5 inches (18 to 27 cm) wide. 
		           Wider decks can be used for greater stability when transition or ramp skating. 
		           Standard skateboard decks are usually between 28 and 33 inches (71 and 84 cm) long. 
		           The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.</p>
			
		        <h2>Trucks</h2>
		        <img src="images/truck.jpg" alt="trucks" class="center">
			         <p>Attached to the deck are two metal (usually aluminum alloy) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. 
		           The trucks are further composed of two parts. The top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the baseplate, and beneath it is the hanger. 
		           The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are bushings, also rubbers or grommets, that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. 
		           The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. 
		           The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. 
		           Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more stability</p>			
			
		        <h2>Wheels</h2>
		        <img src="images/wheel.jpg" alt="wheels" class="center">
			         <p>The wheels of a skateboard are usually made of polyurethane, and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. 
		           Larger width sizes like 55 to 85 mm roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. 
		           Smaller width sizes like 48 to 54 mm keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity 
		           which allows for a better response time, but also make for a  slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding.</p>
